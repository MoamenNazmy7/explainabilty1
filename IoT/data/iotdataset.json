So I told him to find a manufacturer already using those parts and then design his product using their base system. That way he could get scale pricing without having to purchase huge quantities. With my experience I knew what the key components were for his concept, where to look, and who to call. I don't think you can replicate that information in a guide.<p>Sadly right now I'm too busy to help much.

I&#x27;m guessing the lower half won&#x27;t be able to afford any at all, they&#x27;re lucky to eat and drink clean water and maybe have sanitation facilities sometimes, which boosts the sales load to maybe twenty for every upper middle class American, per year.  However by a pigeon-hole principle its going to be difficult to wear more than one pair of shoes at a time, and my generation hasn&#x27;t worn a wristwatch since the 90s, and probably isn&#x27;t going to start again any time soon.<p>Its interesting tech, but exponential charts going into the indefinite future make it look more anti-propaganda by an opponent more than someone into it.  For example if the smartphone growth curve of 2007 continued into today, I&#x27;d have to carry 850 cellphones in my pockets this year, and 2025 phones in my pocket next year, or whatever.  Things that can&#x27;t continue forever tend to stop after awhile.<p>As an early adopter type guy I find my fitbit to be completely useless, no actionable items or decision making is actually done (as opposed to &quot;people should&quot; type of talk).  On the other hand, the scale I bought from the same place gets used every day and its nice and slow and clunky at taking measurements (intentionally?) so consciously or not it provides some actionable data &#x2F; motivation.  Although it varies in the short term by 2 to 3 pounds, I&#x27;ve lost about a pound per week since buying the scale over a long term because I don&#x27;t like seeing the numbers go up consistently.<p>The problem with &quot;smart underwear&quot; or whatever wearable product is not so much to convince people that &quot;people should care&quot; in an abstract sense but get them as individuals to actually do something.  In that way its an aspirational good like paper encyclopedias used to be, which were mostly sold to illiterate people who never read them.  &quot;People should care&quot; about how many steps they take in a day.  I&#x27;m a serious hiker&#x2F;walker type and even for me my fitbit is much more a discipline tracker of how often I forget to wear it than anything else.  The proper market to compare them to is the paper encyclopedia market, not the cellphone or social media market.<p>The other problem in the field is product fluff.  Yes a magic star trek tricoder that sends my real time EKG to a doctor would be really cool, but all the industry is going to provide is a sorta inaccurate pedometer and you&#x27;ll like it.  Or more likely, not, and when the buzz dies down and the industry segment shuts down you won&#x27;t even get that anymore, which is too bad.<p>The main thing my fitbit does is get triggered into sleep mode in my pocket, which annoys me.

Of course, Elixir is similar to Scala in terms of implementation - they both compile to bytecode instead of transpiling like CS. But the features Elixir brings to the BEAM are less groundbreaking and more practical, just like in CoffeeScript and unlike Scala, which transforms JVM so much that it&#x27;s almost invisible.<p>There&#x27;s a difference, too - JS is being reworked and Harmony will bring many improvements which Coffee has today, but I&#x27;m not aware of &quot;next generation Erlang&quot; being actively worked on (Joe Armstrong does erl2, but I don&#x27;t know how active it is).

But it still does not scale. The design requires to upload a Python SDK to the memory of the second chip and requires SSL for security. SSL is slow in terms of the performance of a device response. It&#x27;s redundant. Wi-Fi itself is very secure if the message can be transported on a lower level.<p>Alternative solutions could be: unify all the smart devices at home using home computer as a central control which will send messages back and forth to the smart phone or remote control. Between the central controlling program and the devices, some type of communication either on the HTTP level or lower level will help. It&#x27;s not necessary to bring everything onto the Internet, only the web server on the home computer is exposed, which is a lot more secure. This way, your smart phone only need to have one app to control all the smart devices at home.<p>More aggressive solution is to control the smart devices on a lower level than HTTP from the cloud, so that the cost of building the smart devices can be reduced significantly, keeping the device price minimum change from the traditional devices.

Bug Labs, you guys are still around. I remember back in the Summer of 2006 when the BugBox was the hot product.  I was trying to build a real-time geo-tagging service to tag <i>speed traps</i> using the BugBox[1].  Then 6 months later, Steven Paul Jobs came though with the hand of magic, announced the iPhone with all of the sensors that were in the bug box with a much better product and simultaneously erased the Bug Labs from my mind.  As far as <a href=\"http://dweet.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dweet.io</a>, this looks like a very good implementation of a message bus.  The two things I&#x27;m worried about with this project are performance and concurrency.<p>Lets start with performance. If you&#x27;re trying to get a predicted 26 billion devices by 2020[2] on a Node.js&#x2F;Socket.io Framework, you&#x27;re going to need so many machines, the business case wont be viable.  Socket.io is great for  message passing, but at high throughput, it&#x27;s going to fall short.  Message busses like \u00d8MQ (ZeroMQ) are a lot lighter and can bind to file descriptor without requiring spawning up an HTTP server.  As for Node.js performance; It&#x27;s great for JSON serialization (Which you&#x27;re going to be doing a lot of), but it&#x27;s far from the fastest.  Node blows away languages&#x2F;frameworks like Ruby&#x2F;Rails and Python&#x2F;Django in speed when it comes to JSON serialization (And almost anything else), but it&#x27;s still in the 30th percentile for JSON serialization which is very low[3].  With this being one of your most performed operations, this is something that should be as fast as possible.<p>As far as concurrency is concerned; Node.js isn&#x27;t an inherently concurrent language although it does have it&#x27;s non-blocking I&#x2F;O callback magic.  Obviously, you can use modules like cluster, the native process spawning or backgrounder[4], but the weight of threads is going to be so expensive compared to the amount of work that&#x27;s needed to be preformed.  Supporting concurrent paradigms like RUN.At, RUN.Until, RUN.After, RUN.Every, RUN.WithTimeout, and RUN.BatchJobs are easy to do in Node.js, but then getting those individual processes to talk to each other in an orderly fashion using callbacks and Socket.io seems like duct tape and chewing gum over just using a language that supports concurrency natively.<p>Other than that, I love it, I understand the vision (because we&#x27;re building something similar), and I&#x27;m very glad that you guys open sourced this project.<p>[1] - <a href=\"http://www.vroomtrap.com/downloads\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vroomtrap.com&#x2F;downloads</a><p>[2] - <a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2636073\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gartner.com&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;id&#x2F;2636073</a><p>[3] - <a href=\"http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r8&amp;hw=i7&amp;test=json\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techempower.com&#x2F;benchmarks&#x2F;#section=data-r8&amp;hw=i7...</a><p>[4] - <a href=\"http://jolira.github.io/backgrounder/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jolira.github.io&#x2F;backgrounder&#x2F;</a>", "time": 1391873994, "type": "comment", "label": "story"}, {"by": "jheising", "id": 7201742, "parent": 7201423, "text": "Thanks for the feedback! To be clear, the node.js library is just a client-side library, so it should only be technically running on a single machine in most cases.<p>Also, we only use socket.io for real-time pubsub, but you could just as easily use a polling mechanism with HTTP to get similar results if you&#x27;re worried about the performance and overhead it carries.<p>I think perhaps the most important thing is to be very clear about our goals here. Dweet.io is NOT built for super low-latency pub&#x2F;sub. IMHO most devices in the future of IOT won&#x27;t need to communicate to the cloud more than a few times every minute or at the most once per second. For the devices that need low-latency (sub-second) pub&#x2F;sub, I agree, you should look at other protocols like MqTT.

It tries to explain social phenomena in terms of how &quot;actors&quot; -- both humans and nonhumans -- interact in networks.<p>ANT is a popular approach among sociologists who study scientific and technological developments, but it&#x27;s also highly controversial because it sees nonhuman things as being just as integral to the network as humans are. Instead of humans <i>using</i> phones to produce various social phenomena, for example, humans and phones act together according to ANT. As if phones had a volition of their own. Critics of ANT argue that this is nonsense. Proponents of ANT reply that you don&#x27;t need to have your own will in order to participate meaningfully in a social network.<p>For most of human history, it seemed that people simply <i>used</i> things to get what they want. The things in question were too simple, often no more than a chunk of rock. Surely the interaction between ancient populations was much more interesting than their interaction with rocks? But even in the stone age, those simple tools had a tremendous effect on the fate of the humans who wielded them, so it&#x27;s often useful for historians and anthropologists to ask how things <i>interacted with</i> people, instead of just asking how people <i>used</i> them <i>in</i> their interaction with one another. It&#x27;s a useful change of perspectives, a different algorithm perhaps, that yields interesting theorerical insights.<p>But now it seems like ANT might be more than a novelty method. It could actually be a <i>substantially better</i> perspective than the traditional alternatives. More and more &quot;things&quot; are becoming &quot;smart&quot;. They are no longer being unilaterally used by us; they use us too, and are in turn used by others. They get a life of their own and adapt to completely unforseen uses. They are reused and abused; in turn, they reuse and abuse the information we feed them. As long as you have an IP address, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether you have a brain or a CPU. You exchange information as equals, you process them, and you propagate your results to the rest of the network.<p>Perhaps the fundamental relationship between us and our tools hasn&#x27;t changed at all. But if so, the emergence of the Internet of Things and Humans makes it much easier for us to <i>recognize</i> that we never really unilaterally used anything after all. Nothing in nature unilaterally uses anything else. It&#x27;s always a two-way interaction, whether it&#x27;s between a Neanderthal and his rock or between you and your self-driving car.<p>All French sociologists are crazy, but some of them are geniuses.", "time": 1397711553, "type": "comment", "label": "story"}, {"deleted": true, "id": 7602802, "parent": 7602093, "time": 1397729939, "type": "comment", "label": "story"}, {"by": "lowglow", "id": 7602026, "kids": [7602591], "parent": 7601960, "text": "SFHN + Techendo are throwing an IoT Hackathon on the 25th: <a href=\"http://hackendo-integrate-2014.eventbrite.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackendo-integrate-2014.eventbrite.com</a><p>Come out if you&#x27;re interested!", "time": 1397709819, "type": "comment", "label": "story"}, {"by": "morenoh149", "id": 7602591, "parent": 7602026, "text": "don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re getting downvoted.

Additionally we are not as sensitive to narrowband interference that are caused by other devices such as garage door openers and toys that are also running on the band.<p>\u201cTo further reduce interference and maximize battery life for tracking applications, the Iota does not transmit any messages to the Home Base unless the owner of the Iota opens up the smartphone app and requests a location update.

Going all the way into the kitchen and back just to flip a switch and to come back and wait for 5 minutes seems insane these days. Things that could be dangerous like these would need additional sensors and safeguards against forgetfulness or deliberate exploitation, of course, but with this topic we&#x27;re talking about a next-gen stack of technology instead of a Ben Franklin coil in a box with a knob. I believe the reason these things have not already been tackled (at least not for the mass-market) is that the production costs are disproportionately high compared with consumer demand for those small conveniences, considering most of these types of devices already do not need frequent replacement or upgrade, and are prohibitively expensive for a lot of households in the first place.<p>My laundry machines and dishwasher are relatively smart appliances, but again, it&#x27;s needlessly wasteful to have to remember to walk all the way across my house to check on their progress instead of just receiving a notification when they are done, and being able to view their usage and performance stats on a dashboard somewhere to make better decisions about how and when to use them. It&#x27;d be nice to be able to load up each machine and let it decide when to begin its cycles based on how full it is and with delayed timing to optimize for the lowest cost electricity.<p>A refrigerator that can track the weight and volume of its contents and help maintain a shopping list is something we&#x27;ve talked about having for decades, but none has ever been successful yet. I&#x27;m not suggesting this is easy functionality to solve for, but perhaps thinking about it in different ways would help. What if each compartment were operated independently and could do more than just maintain a cool temp? Maybe a box that controls temp all the way from freezing to roasting as well as humidity. It could take your dishes prepped for cooking the night before and go ahead and heat them up to be ready to eat at the appropriate time, with no second manual process needed. It could double as a dehydrator, and maybe even keep track of when things will expire and pre-emptively dry them to avoid waste. If this were a stackable thing big enough to fit a big turkey or a pizza inside, I could imagine having several of them stacked or spread out instead of the traditional fridge&#x2F;freezer combo box that can only be installed in one place in my house, and is hard to access under&#x2F;behind for maintenance.<p>Speaking of maintenance, if we&#x27;re already adding some small general-purpose computer to each of these things, why not have them all self-contain operation and maintenance manuals, and politely remind when they are due for some cleaning or repairs? Most of these devices don&#x27;t need to have a built in display, but instead should be managed via a web page or connected software on a phone, tablet, or other PC. I think it&#x27;d be pretty nice to open a general-purpose smartphone app and within a few taps get a step-by-step illustrated guide on how to properly replace some part or do routine cleaning on any of my dozens of household devices. The next step beyond that is to even be able to order the replacement parts or 3D-print them locally from the same app.<p>What I&#x27;m especially interested in at the moment is aquaponic&#x2F;aeroponic household gardening&#x2F;farming and how to assemble a reasonably small and self-contained low-to-zero maintenance system that just tells me when to add food or chemicals and when individual plants&#x2F;fish are ideal for harvest. I&#x27;ve been playing around with a Back to the Roots Aqua Farm, which is just a simple Betta fish tank with an integrated herb garden system on top, where the fish feeds the plants and the plants keep the water clean. This is really just a lower-hassle way of keeping a small fish, but the same principle works for larger setups with edible fish and plants and there are a lot of &quot;everything you need to get started&quot; kits out there but I have yet to see a true &quot;open box, add water, insert fish and seeds&quot; package other than this one, and of course it&#x27;s extremely dumb as far as self-maintenance goes, the only real benefit being that you have a fish tank that doesn&#x27;t need to be manually cleaned as often. A more sophisticated setup would involve timed pumping, grow lights, and autonomously administered food and maintenance chemicals, where really all you have to do is harvest and replace the plants and fish, and keep re-filling the stockpiles of whatever food and other additives are needed to keep everything in optimal health. I&#x27;d be really interested in buying such a setup in some type of one-box form-factor, and I think that such a thing may really be the future of sustainable agriculture.

They include psychotic techniques like:<p>* Proposing that the symmetric NAT box assigns ports sequentially and trying the next few (may look like a port scan).<p>* Proposing that the symmetric NAT box may assign ports using the standard K&amp;R linear congruential rand() function, inductively determining the PRNG state, and guessing the next ports by extrapolating the next sequence numbers (also may look like a port scan).<p>* Impersonating a DNS server and sending a packet that refers to the NAT-t target as if it were a delegated DNS server (apparently some symmetric NATs have DPI logic to make stuff like this work, which can be exploited... but this can look like an attack).<p>* Having the host behind symmetric NAT probe its own exterior ports 1024-65535 and determine the port assignment schema by doing NAT-t against itself (looks like an attack).<p>* Impersonating IPSec and triggering &quot;make IPSec VPNs work&quot; DPI logic in the router (absolutely requires &#x27;root&#x27; on the host and SOCK_RAW, which Windows doesn&#x27;t have).<p>* Various &quot;Jackass stunts&quot; with ICMP that can set of IDS systems.<p>I would not do any of that stuff in a Real Product(tm), but it&#x27;s all cool in a cool hack kind of way.<p>Nevertheless, the statistical rarity of symmetric means that just relaying peoples&#x27; traffic for free is basically... free... at least within reason.<p>As far as I know BitTorrent does use hole punching, but maybe not in the <i>official</i> bittorrent.com client.

There are many cases where you can talk to a server but you can&#x27;t talk to a peer, ranging from evil firewalls to excessive layers of NAT to simple things like the target device being offline. Thus, you must code a fallback that talks to a server if you want reliability. This server fallback will work for <i>all</i> situations, so it&#x27;s necessarily easier to just use it for everything and not bother to code the P2P bit at all.<p>P2P is also really hard to do well. It&#x27;s pretty easy to do poorly: have one device tell the other device what its IP address is and a port to connect to, then connect to it. In practice, this fails about 99% of the time because approximately all consumer internet users are behind NAT these days. So then you enter the wonderful world of NAT traversal meaning you have to deal with horrifying things like UPNP, NAT-PMP, and STUN. And this is when both sides keep the same IP address throughout the connection! Now consider when your smartphone user goes from Starbucks, where he has WiFi, to the bus, where he only has LTE, to home, where he has WiFi again.<p>Bandwidth is cheap. Let&#x27;s say it would take Snapchat one developer-month to implement this, or about $10,000. (I&#x27;d wager this would be a strong underestimate, both in terms of time required and the cost of that time.) Amazon S3, to take a random example, charges 12 cents per GB of outgoing transfer to the internet at lower use levels. You can buy 83TB with that $10,000. If your typical Snapchat image is 1MB (they&#x27;re low resolution, right?) then you&#x27;d have to P2P 83 million images before you broke even on the investment.

I&#x27;ve worked on apps like SnapChat, so I am probably pretty close to an authority on why apps like that don&#x27;t use p2p.<p>The first problem is that mobile devices are pretty much inherently asynchronous.  There are apps that you would use at the same time as another person (like real-time games) but especially on cellular, lag is an issue.  This pushes people into designing products that can tolerate lag measured in seconds (because that isn&#x27;t shockingly bad performance on cellular networks for apps that use your standard off-the-shelf tools like REST&#x2F;HTTPS&#x2F;AWS for example).  This produces a lot of asynchronous, or semi-asynchronous applications.<p>Now partly due to those product designs, and partly due to people having lives, they use these apps asynchronously. You pull out SnapChat, fire off a message, and go back to reading Reddit or whatever.  Snapchat is off.  There&#x27;s no way to reach you.<p>Okay, so why don&#x27;t we run SnapChat in the background?  Well there are layers of reasons.  The first layer is that it costs energy, and the mobile revolution is in large part possible because software and hardware developers got very aggressive about energy management.  If we ran things in the background like you do on your laptop it would need to be as big as your laptop and plugged in regularly like your laptop.  There are also practical problems, like announcing every time your network address changes, or even <i>figuring out</i> when your network address changes, which is hard to do passively.  I&#x27;m glossing over some networking details but there&#x27;s a deep principle here that within the design of existing TCP&#x2F;IP&#x2F;cellular stack you can&#x27;t have reliability, energy-efficiency, and decentralization.  You must pick 2.<p>Apple, very presciently IMHO, has decided to legislate a lot of rules about background processes that I don&#x27;t have time to go into here but basically they try to regulate the types of work that apps can do in the background to only the energy-efficient kind.  The rules are actually pretty well-designed but they&#x27;re still rules and they restrict what you can do.  Android doesn&#x27;t have this limitation but unless your product is Android-only you&#x27;re going to comply with the iOS rules when you design a feature that communicates across platforms.<p>Okay, so we can&#x27;t run Snapchat in the background.  But what if two users happen to have it open?  We can use p2p then right?<p>Well sure.  But the user may be on a network that blocks p2p traffic.  That is their network&#x27;s fault, but they still e-mail you to complain, and leave bad reviews for your product, because as far as they can see &quot;the Internet works&quot; so it&#x27;s your app&#x27;s fault.<p>So what you do is you design a scheme that uses p2p by default and client-server as a fallback.  There are actually apps that work like this.  Problem here is, instead of getting support tickets about it not working, now you get support tickets about it being slow.<p>And there are ways to solve this, like permanently giving up on p2p after a certain numbers of failures for example.  But the first experience is still pretty bad, which is what counts in mobile.  And I remind you, this p2p feature is already a scheme that only works in the 0.3% of cases that users actually have the app open at the same time, and now you want to add code that disables p2p in even more cases than it&#x27;s disabled already.  This process continues until basically zero actual customers will ever use the feature.<p>And we haven&#x27;t even gotten to cases like &quot;Why didn&#x27;t this message get delivered to all my devices?&quot; because there is just zero chance that any customer, anywhere, will have all his devices turned on at the right time to receive incoming p2p connections.<p>Now non-messaging products like Spotify or Netflix are more plausible, but you still have to ask who wins here.  Customer experience is worse, both because of connectivity problems and increasing bandwidth bills and the energy efficiency losses that comes with rebroadcasting content to other users.  Developers are worse because they probably have to build <i>both</i> client-server and p2p architecture, because p2p isn&#x27;t reliable enough on its own.  Support is worse because almost any issue is potentially a p2p-related issue, have you tried disabling p2p and seeing if the issue persists?<p>There&#x27;s really no reason, certainly no compelling business case, to inflict that much pain on any mobile product I can think of.

It is focused on specialization within those trends rather than just a broad overview. The difference is specialization or niche in these markets can mean the difference from surviving as a business or failing.<p>Something else to be aware of is if you develop something now you are most likely to see it&#x27;s production use within 3-5 years of development and then you are most likely to see it&#x27;s market either growing or not in 10 years. This is an interesting dichotomy because it means picking things that may be hard but boring, or fun depending on how you look at them.<p>I am not affiliated with any of these companies. I just think some of them are well-placed in the market.<p>-Devops (mostly containers and virtualization software, but also fast&#x2F;easy build software, customizable configs that adapt better and searchable&#x2F;informative apis)<p>-Devops massive ssl&#x2F;managing keys&#x2F;passwords deployment software (there are a few automated tools that may help with this but there is in general not too many companies currently handling it)<p>-Devops massive worker model software or software that helps automation in newer&#x2F;interesting ways like stackengine (<a href=\"http://stackengine.com/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackengine.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;</a>) just got $1 million in funding and provides a way to convert vagrant images to docker images and back again in a fast fashion<p>-Devops with companies that provide continuous integration at scale or preconfigured devops things that require too much learning to integrate etc, or alternatively lease integration tools. Also managed data worflow between many integrative models. <a href=\"https://jidoteki.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jidoteki.com&#x2F;</a><p>-Saas, PaaS, etc software as a service especially in devops looks to be going in several directions or so: 1)safe php applications using sandstorm sandbox and type-safe php llvm type stuff (integrating some of parse: <a href=\"https://parse.com/docs/php_guide\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;parse.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;php_guide</a> which makes traveling from one php application to another seamless, and Hoa which makes dsls more manageable <a href=\"http://hoa-project.net/En/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hoa-project.net&#x2F;En&#x2F;</a> ) 2)devops delivered through docker + automated binary releases 3)devops in nodejs that controls docker and other things or just low latency&#x2F;fast productive js (dart could be a good useful bet) 4)determinable execution type programming mostly ocaml and haskell which are considered 90% correct and safer languages 5)clojure immutable data that can be shared between large amounts of web online applications<p>-safe low latency&#x2F;low requirement distributed services<p>-large data crunching (think distributed versus not distributed, purpose of what it is doing, competition)<p>-the coming large amount of &quot;internet of things&quot; in the next few years will be tons of small robots because of finally cheap enough robotics that they will be buyable + good software markets from many different companies working together The internet of things opens a new dimension for SaaS products that interact seamlessly this is an idealistic idea for how to structure something like that as many multiple agents: <a href=\"http://eve.almende.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;eve.almende.com&#x2F;</a>\nAlso training an AI in a massive simulation with cloud&#x2F;distributed tech with machine learning algorithms for real usage is a definite possibility<p>-privacy software (anonymous logins like facebook did, garbled circuits and homomorphic encryption, encrypted multiparty applications like auctions for bidding etc and cloud computing)<p>-artificial intelligence (not just &quot;deep learning&quot; on it&#x27;s own like convnets which are doing good performance wise but lack overall structural use, but intelligent software that can solve problems using many other algorithmic components like bloom filters, markov chains, dynamic time warping etc that focuses on specific problem solving interactive on-work jobs, data cleaning, vision, speech recognition and NLP)As a side-note if someone was able to improve data cleaning they can reduce a lot of errors by a large % and is under-utilized at the moment. Although it is problematic that most active learning algorithms ask for a lot more quesitons: <a href=\"https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/publication/scaling-up-crowd-sourcing-to-very-large-datasets-a-case-for-active-learning/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amplab.cs.berkeley.edu&#x2F;publication&#x2F;scaling-up-crowd-...</a> . Crowd answering has been a better use for data cleaning.)<p>-Specifically Artificial Intelligence in vision through point cloud library needs to be more useful. Vision will need to be a very automated and big process and is not talked about as much on how hard it is to determine vision constraints like object detection and avoiding using edge detection etc. Simply learning to move is not the only problem associated with AI since vision is hard: <a href=\"http://pointclouds.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pointclouds.org&#x2F;</a><p>-Specifically Artifical Intelligence using networking to off-load some of the heavy load in computing lots of difficult&#x2F;complicated tasks by automating large chunks of activity as computer signals this is known as macroprogramming: <a href=\"http://fiji.eecs.harvard.edu/Macroprogramming\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fiji.eecs.harvard.edu&#x2F;Macroprogramming</a> )<p>-3D Printing (I think metal 3d printing or harder material like construction from cement is more successful than regular plastic 3d printing as it can lead to more things getting done. 3d printing could be improved wholesale from some re-imaging by making it from adaptable molds rather than a dripple of material that moves (different concept than most 3d printing and may provide different results). Cheaper materials that are durable integration into actual electronics or support for holding computer chips in the printed models)<p>-Better safer faster payment gateways<p>-Anything security that helps solve the massive cybercrime problem that still plagues every major company (using AI for reviewing security control policies, account policies, and more CYBR IPO does this)<p>-Also related in security Intrusion detection systems have risen over 30% in sales lately, and despite defense being a lot better upgraded recently there are still many evident attack vectors. A key factor in this is companies by policy are almost always forced to use older technology, people enjoy renting out windows computers and windows computers have better virtualization server balancing support because they are the most tested)<p>-data content management systems that make data more available and easily constructable&#x2F;displayable<p>-I like how you mentioned &quot;wearables&quot; as a seperate category. There are many things that could be wearables that are not watches most likely that people could use. A swiss army knife type thing (something that can solve many problems) that is electronic yet still carryable on a normal day basis or maybe job specific could take off.<p>-Using constraint provers to reason around problems in the human domain (math etc) or in computer optimization&#x2F;security<p>-Generated business reports using machine learning + formatting (abuse free services like ipython, ihaskell, etc for output)<p>-Tools that keep people productive (extremely wide category there is lots of old software in it, but mostly is just old, any new way with better UI and more useful features can surpass tons of old software.)<p>-A &quot;sensor world.&quot; Sensors cost near to nothing now (just a few cents under a dollar) and they can be placed basically everywhere. There needs to be a better hive-mind like use for them. Also pretty soon phone apps or simple vision type apps could be able to quickly identify objects around them using web-apps and machine learning that could provide specs or information on them as well as interact with them.<p>-Just simply &quot;tech of tommorrow.&quot; Things that &quot;can scale&quot; massively or improve performance tech wise with speciality in that domain, though this isn&#x27;t likely a first startup idea.<p>Note: I can list more if people want or I could expand with more specific examples of software or companies that do things in these fields etc. Feel free to reply.", "time": 1412231007, "type": "comment", "label": "story"}, {"by": "switch33", "id": 8399741, "parent": 8399634, "text": "A simpler way: Look at what big tech company x is doing that looks to be selling.

have recently started a cloud-based receipting platform startup called Voucher. Voucher is a smart receipt printer that seamlessly and wirelessly sends a digital receipt to the consumer&#x27;s smartphone right at the checkout line for all transactions involving a credit&#x2F;debit card. No more pockets, handbags, murses, or glovebox compartments filled with crumpled receipts. Voucher uses proprietary technology for which we have a patent pending, and is thus at the forefront of the Internet of Things (IoT) revolution.<p>With 82+ Billion credit&#x2F;debit card transactions annually in just the US alone.Retailers in the US spend 3.4 Billion dollars a year on just the printer paper alone. Voucher has the potential to benefit both consumers and retailers, financially and environmentally.<p>We would really appreciate your comments, wisdom, advice, and support both publicly and financially as we attempt to realize our venture. Follow us on Twitter: @Voucher_Co for more informations and updates.<p>Check out our crowdfunding page on indiegogo<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiegogo.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;voucher-world-s-first-smart-receipt-printer", "time": 1418194346, "title": "Our StartUp Voucher,Solution to Paper Receipts the World Has Been Waiting For", "type": "story", "url": "", "label": "story"}, {"by": "vincentg64", "descendants": 0, "id": 8732772, "score": 1, "text": "", "time": 1418262450, "title": "Big Data, IOT and Security \u2013 OH MY", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/big-data-iot-and-security-oh-my", "label": "story"}, {"by": "skempe", "dead": true, "id": 8736884, "score": 1, "text": "", "time": 1418329580, "title": "2015 Trends for the Internet of Things", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.dataversity.net/2015-trends-internet-things/", "label": "story"}, {"by": "rmmw", "descendants": 0, "id": 8743496, "score": 3, "text": "", "time": 1418429924, "title": "a16z Interview: Better interfaces for programming the internet of things", "type": "story", "url": "http://a16z.com/2014/12/11/better-interfaces-for-programming-the-internet-of-things/", "label": "story"}, {"by": "Peroni", "descendants": 0, "id": 8752469, "score": 2, "text": "", "time": 1418657918, "title": "How to win an Internet of Things hackday", "type": "story", "url": "http://developers.lyst.com/hardware/2014/12/15/iot-hackday/", "label": "story"}, {"by": "apadillaf", "descendants": 0, "id": 8755025, "score": 1, "text": "", "time": 1418684961, "title": "Corona SDK and Arduino Hacks,the Book of the Internet of Things", "type": "story", "url": "https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/corona-sdk-arduino-hacks-the-book/x/495838", "label": "story"}, {"by": "dianabaciu", "descendants": 0, "id": 8756842, "score": 1, "text": "", "time": 1418733612, "title": "Your Thing Is Pwnd: Security Challenges for the Internet of Things", "type": "story", "url": "http://qconlondon.com/presentation/your-thing-pwnd-security-challenges-internet-things?utm_source=hacker&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=iothacker", "label": "story"}, {"by": "janjongboom", "descendants": 3, "id": 8757006, "kids": [8758984, 8757222], "score": 24, "text": "", "time": 1418736763, "title": "Firefox OS as an Internet of Things Platform", "type": "story", "url": "http://ee.telenor.io/gonzo/hardware/2014/12/16/firefox-os-iot.html", "label": "story"}, {"by": "tzm", "id": 8758984, "kids": [8759874], "parent": 8757006, "text": "The OS architecture is described as a comparison to Tessel:<p>Hardware -&gt; Linux (Android kernel) -&gt; Gecko (Browser engine) -&gt; HTML5 UI<p>However, Tessel is implemented using a JavaScript to Lua transcompiler for C++ bindings.

It seems like each day the internet is growing at an ever expanding rate. More and more devices are being connected to the internet, and more and more people are gaining access to these devices.<p>I feel like IoT (the internet of things) is the next big step for technology, and for internet connected devices. The internet of things is the idea that every single device, including ordinary objects, can become internet-connected devices. Beyond that, I believe the internet of things improves upon already existing devices. There is a great analogy that I use (I didn&#x27;t come up with it XD):<p>The vending machine automatically notifies the company that there are no drinks left.<p>See the internet of things also includes the fact that these internet connected devices become connected to other devices. I believe that this could improve our forms of communication, but it could also allow for devices to become completely autonomous.<p>I&#x27;m just curious to see your opinion about IoT.

The thing that will really make it take off is going to be something that we haven&#x27;t thought of or currently thing is impossible.<p>The biggest issue that still needs to be overcome is the security. Sure, you can get it to be as secure as anything else today using traditional (D)TLS and certs, but some of these devices are have a (shelf) life of over 10 years. What happens to all the devices on the shelf (or just not turned on) if your CA was diginotar? Either you keep your now insecure cert so that devices can still connect to download the new cert or you just remove it and force everyone to do a firmware update manually. Do you really expect your grandma to update the firmware on their smoke detector? If you just leave it, how long do you support it?<p>All that assumes that you&#x27;re okay with the wide variety of privacy issues that come with having all this data streamed from your house (or business or whatever) up into someone else&#x27;s servers. I think another thing that is going to be important is a &quot;local iot&quot;, none of your data is able to leave a small box inside your house except for small bits of things that actually need to, like notifications or alert states.

My research topic is design of ultra low power radios for internet of thing nodes. Since I will be soon searching for a job I would like to ask for some career advice from you.<p>The first question is regarding working as an integrated circuit designer for a small company. Since circuit design is a very high upkeep activity (money required for software licenses, technology access, clusters for simulations, runs, testing etc) I was wondering how do small companies deal with these expenses. Since at this point my career goal is to continue developing my skills as an IC designer, do you think that choosing to work for a small company might be a suboptimal decision?<p>The second question is if you know any smaller companies which are looking for people with my profile (in Europe or USA). Most people around me talk about the big semiconductor companies being involved in chip design for IoT stuff, but given the hype this domain is getting in the press, I figure that there must be smaller players involved as well.<p>Thanks!", "time": 1428743605, "title": "Ask HN: Internet of Things job opportunities?", "type": "story", "url": "", "label": "ask"}, {"by": "mgunes", "descendants": 0, "id": 9359168, "score": 1, "text": "", "time": 1428752857, "title": "Honeywell, I\u2019m Home! the Internet of Things and the New Domestic Landscape", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.e-flux.com/journal/honeywell-im-home-the-internet-of-things-and-the-new-domestic-landscape/", "label": "story"}, {"by": "mobman", "descendants": 0, "id": 9366095, "score": 1, "text": "", "time": 1428903321, "title": "Winners-Intel IOT RoadShow Banglore,India", "type": "story", "url": "https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/intel-r-iot-roadshow-bangalore-india/hacks/drivealert", "label": "story"}, {"by": "stinos", "descendants": 0, "id": 9376261, "score": 4, "text": "", "time": 1429035731, "title": "The WiPy: The Internet of Things Taken to the Next Level", "type": "story", "url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wipy/the-wipy-the-internet-of-things-taken-to-the-next", "label": "story"}, {"by": "cormacdriver", "descendants": 0, "id": 9376715, "score": 2, "text": "", "time": 1429040088, "title": "Take Control of Your Internet of Things Data with Temboo Streaming", "type": "story", "url": "https://temboo.com/streaming", "label": "story"}, {"by": "GLM_Group", "dead": true, "id": 9379985, "score": 1, "time": 1429093912, "title": "Internet of Things to deliver US$1.9 trillion boost to supplychain/logistics ops", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.globallogisticsmedia.com/articles/view/internet-of-things-will-deliver-us19-trillion-boost-to-supply-chain-and-logistics-operations---rep#.VS49mTD3SEA.hackernews", "label": "story"}, {"by": "umeboshi", "descendants": 0, "id": 9384821, "score": 1, "time": 1429138697, "title": "7 API-In-a-Box Startups for Connecting to the Internet of Things", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.programmableweb.com/news/7-api-box-startups-connecting-to-internet-things/elsewhere-web/2015/04/15", "label": "story"}, {"by": "tkschneider", "descendants": 0, "id": 9390347, "score": 4, "time": 1429213585, "title": "NIST official: Internet of Things is indefensible \u2013 FCW", "type": "story", "url": "http://fcw.com/articles/2015/04/16/iot-is-indefensible.aspx", "label": "story"}, {"by": "agsbcap", "descendants": 0, "id": 9397272, "score": 2, "text": "", "time": 1429305829, "title": "MongoDB poised to play a key role in managing the Internet of things", "type": "story", "url": "http://gomorpheus.com/blog/2015-04-17-mongodb-poised-to-play-a-key-role-in-managing-the-internet-of-things", "label": "story"}, {"by": "jonbaer", "descendants": 0, "id": 9402190, "score": 4, "time": 1429423525, "title": "According to a NIST Analyst, the Internet of Things Is Indefensible", "type": "story", "url": "http://motherboard.vice.com/read/according-to-a-nist-analyst-the-internet-of-things-is-indefensible2", "label": "story"}, {"by": "simas", "descendants": 3, "id": 9403217, "kids": [9408247, 9404639], "score": 5, "text": "", "time": 1429453283, "title": "We Need to Get the Internet of Things Right", "type": "story", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/19/we-need-to-get-the-internet-of-things-right/", "label": "story"}, {"by": "pforpineapple", "id": 9408247, "parent": 9403217, "text": "This is very interesting.

Who&#x27;s paying for the broadband connections in every store?<p>3) Who is going to write the dashboard that lets corp see the nifty graphics about system uptime?  Who maintains that?

I have a generic &quot;far north&quot; HVAC system (aka killer efficient condensing furnace, mere afterthought of an AC unit) and its connected to an Insteon compatible thermostat via industry standard wiring and protocols (basically residential thermo is 20 mA current loop for heat&#x2F;fan&#x2F;cool), and that&#x27;s connected to misterhouse via the usual insteon RF bridge and controller.  Integrating it all is hopeless, like late night infomercials for combination fishing pole&#x2F;swiss army knife&#x2F;spark plug wrench gadgets.  Its easier to debug industry standard components, also.<p>I messed around with it some years ago when it was new but haven&#x27;t permanently implemented anything.  I ran into the following problems:<p>1) UI.  When my MiL visits she&#x27;s at the Asimov-ian technological level where everything I do is at a high enough tech level to be magic, and correspondingly she&#x27;s scared&#x2F;intimidated and its all just a non-starter.  She still has a round honeywell with a mercury switch at her house and occasionally does the typical woman thing of adjusting it multiple times a day to either 85 or 60 degrees while complaining &quot;it doesn&#x27;t work&quot;.  To a lesser extent my wife does the same thing, seeing as they&#x27;re related I&#x27;m not surprised.  I&#x27;ve tested it and it works, its just that automatic control even at the simple round honeywell thermostat level is beyond her, pretty much.  This will make smart thermostats a hard sell.  Magic being interchangeable with Magic, this makes smart thermostats a hard sell to most of the population, why not just put a sticker on the existing thermostat like those stickers that increase cell phone battery life 50% or reduce RF exposure by 100%, or basically the entire audiophile industry in a nutshell, or astrology.  I mean a controls engineer KNOWS the bode stability plot analysis of that algorithm is superior, but to the general public its just expensive, much harder to use, astrology.  Astrology being cheaper to implement than actual control theory, I guarantee the IoT will be polluted by &quot;smart&quot; things that are actually dumber than &quot;dumb&quot; things, but none the less very well marketed and likely very successful sellers because they&#x27;ll be cheaper.<p>2) Improvement is missing.  I had some ideas that sucked, but were fun to try.  So cycle the ventilation fan on and off at some rate to save energy rather than run all the time.  Well that makes the place stuffy and if I wanted a stuffy moldy house I&#x27;d have installed a smaller cheaper fan, I&#x27;m not paying this kind of mortgage per month to choke or be chilly, etc.  I ran into similar problems with messing with temperature control, such that anything I did to alter temperatures MOSTLY just reduced comfort.  As far as saving money this was not cheap back then and probably not even now, and I should have spent a couple $$$ on yet more insulation, or even newer windows, or an ever more efficient furnace, etc.  The one protocol that was a winner WRT comfort was slightly warmer temps in the morning when getting up and gradual lowering by bedtime.  A lot of IoT projects are like this, very techno cool nerdy impressive display of hard work and solved engineering problems, but none the less completely utterly useless in practice.  Why, if I spend $300 and a lot of hours, I can turn my nice comfy house into a drafty&#x2F;stuffy dump, but its cheaper just to spend $100K less on the house if you want to slum it.<p>Anyone talking about IoT should be required to watch the black and white (free) Buster Keaton movie from about a century ago titled &quot;electric house&quot;.  There&#x27;s nothing new under the sun and back when electrification was a &quot;thing&quot; there were plenty of crazy gadget ideas that could be made fun of (see the movie) but had no long term impact.  A century from now, 99%+ of IoT will look to the future like Keaton&#x27;s &quot;electric house&quot; looks to us.  There is another immense insight to &quot;electric house&quot; movie that arguably the biggest impact of electricity to daily life is the microwave oven, which obviously was not predictable.  If there is any high impact IoT device in the future, it won&#x27;t be the 24352th model of thermostat, it&#x27;ll be something unimaginable today, or at least unimaginable to almost everyone.

Standardization guys are usually industry representatives from bigger companies who think about inter-op (and to a lesser extent use-cases). But many use-cases in IoT transcend or even threaten the business models of what the bigger players have built their power&#x2F;dominance on (they prefer sustainability over disruption -- god I hate those buzzwords).<p>Therefore smaller innovators (individuals or garage start-ups) who have radical ideas such as building a decentralized business model (maybe using cryptocurrencies or blockchaining and <i>not</i> driven by harvesting user-data or advocate strong privacy) usually don&#x27;t have the resources or time to put one of their staff into the slow-moving standardization bodies to make&#x2F;defend their case.<p>Though the W3 is extremely open compared to others and even there are official members who vote behind closed doors, ... if enough contributors bring ideas in the open discussion groups, then these points too might get standardized.<p>The biggest problem though is standardizing security.<p>It is no coincidence that most IETF drafts especially older ones and official RFC&#x27;s have under &quot;Security&quot; a note that says &quot;to be done&quot;. Thinking ahead what might become a design problem later is hard and depends on how the standard later gets understood by the industry.

IoT devices connect to IoT cloud backends and that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s done. Period.<p>There are several reasons:<p>(1) Vendors desperately want to avoid total commoditization. Competition in the hardware space comes from cheap Chinese vendors with unbelievably cheap labor and monstrous economies of scale. Tethering your device to a backend provides both some amount of lock-in and keeps your secret sauce away from the Chinese reverse engineers. (Or so people think.) This is as true for Chinese vendors as it is for domestic ones-- don&#x27;t expect them to forgo this strategy when their competition is each other.<p>(2) There is no good solution for end-to-end transit that copes with the ugliness of endpoint networks.<p>Full disclosure: I am founder of a company that is trying to address #2 in an open, scalable, reliable, and interoperable way. I am therefore partial to this problem. Yet I also think it may be the easier of the two to solve since it&#x27;s <i>mostly</i> just a technical problem. Problem #1 is deeply baked into the structure of the market and I have no idea how to solve it. Pathological emergent behaviors like this in complex systems like markets are notoriously hard to fix. You can see the train wreck but you as an individual are helpless against it-- in fact you are almost <i>forced</i> to help drive the train off the cliff because every market incentive points that way. Usually the ham-fisted solution of legislation is the only thing that can address such pathologies in the real world. I hate that as a still-semi-libertarian but it is what it is.<p>Edit:<p>It gets worse. Now add:<p>(3) All kinds of creepy agents from governments to crooks to (perhaps worst of all) quasi-crooked &quot;dark pattern&quot; companies who want to &quot;monetize the user,&quot; would <i>love</i> to get as many Internet-connected cameras, microphones, sensors, etc. into your house as they can. It&#x27;s a gold mine of private data they can do creepy things with. Think about the malware situation on PCs -- <i>that is about to happen to your house</i>.<p>#1 and #3 obviously interact constructively. The race-to-the-bottom nature of hardware and the ease with which software is copied means that companies must look for any revenue stream they can. We&#x27;ve seen what this has done to the web: the most successful web companies are free services that monetize the user through surveillance. It&#x27;s hard to imagine that the same economics won&#x27;t drive IoT vendors to the same endpoint.<p>Edit #2:<p>I toy around with the deeply contrarian idea that what we need are significantly stronger intellectual property laws to upend this economic death spiral, but I am not at all convinced that that is the answer or that it would have any chance of working.<p>The other less radical idea is that this is a marketing problem, and that IoT is ripe for a higher-end vendor to come in and say &quot;we aren&#x27;t creepy.&quot;<p>Would customers pay twice as much for a genuinely useful or enjoyable IoT device that came with an iron clad privacy policy, open APIs, and direct connectivity so you could avoid any cloud dependency? The conventional wisdom that I hear endlessly repeated is &quot;customers don&#x27;t care about privacy or security.&quot; I see evidence of this myself -- e.g. not a single user out of many thousand has asked us (ZeroTier) about the quality of our crypto. &quot;It&#x27;s end to end encrypted!&quot; With what? A software implementation of a cereal box cipher? Nobody cares. Yet I wonder: just how creepy do you have to get before people start caring? Do people care when Barbie is listening to their children? When their Amazon Echo is submitting the sound of them having sex to Amazon? How pitifully abusive and downright gross does our relationship with &quot;the cloud&quot; have to get before people actually start caring whether their doors are locked?<p>Okay enough rant -- back to work trying to put a dent in this problem in a way that&#x27;s probably more effective than posting to HN. #1 might be the harder of the two problems but if #2 isn&#x27;t solved there is no chance of #1 being addressed.", "time": 1456762461, "type": "comment", "label": "story"}, {"by": "kefka", "id": 11197259, "kids": [11197525, 11200703], "parent": 11196276, "text": "&gt; (2) There is no good solution for end-to-end transit that copes with the ugliness of endpoint networks.<p>Yes, there is. And it exists right now, and it&#x27;s completely free.<p>TOR.<p>I&#x27;ve been using TOR hidden services for months now. On every machine (Linux), I install TOR and set 22&#x2F;SSH available as a hidden service. This gives me a [HASH].onion address.<p>Now, why is that useful? The Hidden Services gives you a flat address space so that every .onion is reachable easily. There&#x27;s no NAT, no firewalls, no stupid of any sort. And unlike &quot;static IP&#x2F;port forward&#x2F;hole in NAT&#x2F;Dynamic DNS&quot; anti-solution, you install TOR, set up which ports are to be forwarded, and off you go.<p>I&#x27;ve also figured out how to get full .onion resolution on a Linux system as well. That means, instead of having to do a &quot;Run Tor Browser&#x2F;proxy&quot; for every program, you simply use the .onion where you want. The DNS resolver takes care of obfuscation and TOR handing and everything. So that means you could have a list of servers in different physical locations with firewalls, NATS, and other network tools. And you can administer them via CHEF or Puppet or Ansible using a list of .onion in your config files.<p>I use Mosquitto, a MQTT broker to handle my data store. I have sensors in 3 physical different locations (my house, a friend&#x27;s house, and my local hackerspace). I don&#x27;t have access to the border router on 2 of them; but that doesn&#x27;t matter. TOR takes care of all transit.<p>The last piece of this puzzle is Node-Red for handling of IoT data. With the aforementioned DNS solution I figured out, I can pub&#x2F;sub data to my mosquitto broker, sitting on port 8883 on my onion. The Node-Red doesn&#x27;t have to know where the machines are, nor does my Mosquitto broker.<p>My hardware platform is self-made: Arduino Nano clones, nRF24L01+ mesh networking chip, whatever sensors, and the MySensors library.

But the caveat is they fill my niche I need. The TOR part, is something that would work everywhere. Configuring Hidden Services isn&#x27;t hard, but resolving .onions across the system is... So here&#x27;s how to do it.<p>(from my previous comment a few weeks ago)<p>*<p>4 points by kefka 18 days ago | parent | on: The Research Pirates of the Dark Web<p>I find the way TOR is used lacking. I really would like to have .Onion resolution across my whole system (in my case, I extensively use Linux). So, Here&#x27;s a way to do just that:<p>I use a significant amount of HiddenServices to communicate back and forth with my machines. My eventual goal was to be able to process data from different geographical areas and have them inserted into MQTT via Node-Red. Until now, it was all or nothing with regards to proxy settings.<p>I have figured that out. For those that want to integrate seamless .onion usage across the whole of Node-Red (and every other Linux program), follow this.<p>get the following packages (Ubuntu, Debian)<p><pre><code>    sudo apt-get install tor iptables dnsmasq dnsutils\n\n\n \n</code></pre>\nAdd the following to the &#x2F;etc&#x2F;tor&#x2F;torrc file<p><pre><code>    VirtualAddrNetworkIPv4 10.192.0.0&#x2F;10\n    AutomapHostsOnResolve 1\n    TransPort 9040\n    DNSPort 53\n    DNSListenAddress 127.0.0.2\n</code></pre>\nRestart TOR<p><pre><code>    sudo service tor restart\n</code></pre>\nEdit &#x2F;etc&#x2F;dnsmasq.conf and add the following:<p><pre><code>    listen-address=127.0.0.1\n    resolv-file=&#x2F;etc&#x2F;realresolv.conf\n    server=&#x2F;onion&#x2F;127.0.0.2\n</code></pre>\nMake a new file, called &#x2F;etc&#x2F;realresolv.conf . Add this in the file:<p><pre><code>    nameserver 107.170.95.180\n    nameserver 8.8.8.8\n</code></pre>\nRestart DNSmasq:<p><pre><code>    sudo service dnsmasq restart\n</code></pre>\nRun the IPtables firewall update for redirection<p><pre><code>    sudo iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp -d 10.192.0.0&#x2F;10 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 9040\n</code></pre>\nAlso, this script must be run at every boot, so add this in &#x2F;etc&#x2F;rc.local, ABOVE the &quot;exit 0&quot;<p><pre><code>    &#x2F;sbin&#x2F;iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp -d 10.192.0.0&#x2F;10 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 9040\n\n</code></pre>\nOnce you do those things, your whole Linux sustem will be able to resolve .onion addresses seamlessly, yet leaving alone canonical address schemes. this means that you can talk with a MQTT-out on an .onion, or control remote servers via exec node and SSH. And since you don&#x27;t have to poke holes through firewalls, networking between Hidden Nodes with Node-Red sitting on top makes IoT sensor capture from remote areas (Work, home, car, hackerspace) very easy.<p>Of course, this does not discuss how to actually add a new hidden service You should think very hard before enabling a service: Make sure there is good authentication on them along with the newest updates.

It can be unsafe just as anything else out there if it&#x27;s made unsafe.<p>As explained by the company representative (including my own added explanations) the devices, when behind NAT, can not receive any incoming requests without setting up port forwarding in the router (this is done automatically and temporarily for outgoing requests to allow incoming respones, but thats another story). Setting up port forwarding is not a good solution so what I pressume they are doing is that they are connecting to a TURN&#x2F;STUN server from the camera outwards to be able to communicate. When the application wants to connect that one also connects to this server to have the camera create a p2p link (that means direct connection between camera and the device the app is running on). If that one fails then they are relaying the data through their servers.<p>Now there&#x27;s some ceveats for the above solution. If one relies solely on encrypted channels and certificate security it should be as safe as the encryption is strong or the strength of the certificates.

(Name is a blend of the two: Internet of Quantified Self)<p>Our service accepts tagged messages from users, where the tag applies data in the message to a category. Users can configure alerts from the service to be sent to them as reminders to send in data.<p>Sample use case: instead of a bluetooth or wifi connected bathroom scale that sends weights to a remote database, IoQS reminds the user every morning to weight themselves and message the result to the service. Reminders help build habits, and the user doesn&#x27;t need new hardware to collect data.<p>This lets users measure things that are subjective or are hard to measure - such as mood, food eaten, time spent in various activities. Being a general case, the user can choose to measure whatever is important to them. Such things can change with time, and this lets users experiment without having to purchase expensive hardware they may only use for a few weeks.<p>Once the data from an IoQS message is in the cloud, there are many possibilities for comparison with other data sources, graphing, and forming insights for the user. Data can be shared for friendly competition, or possibly with a doctor for medically-relevant tracking.<p>We&#x27;ve got a prototype in private beta using SMS messages for the reminders and user-entered messages.

I&#x27;m curious about the use cases. It&#x27;s basically a remote interface for a spreadsheet or, more abstractly, an array of key:value pairs.<p>The thing is, that&#x27;s kind of a constrained interface. It&#x27;s rare to track only one value at a time. Normally you want to track either sets of values (EX: how many grams protein, fat, carbs) or at least multiple individual values (EX: calories, weight, sleep).<p>So if there&#x27;s nothing new about the data store (IE: just a spreadsheet on a server) and there&#x27;s nothing new about the data (IE: just calories or mood or whatever) then the new part is the interface. Instead of firing up an entire application you do the exact opposite; ping one or two simple codes.<p>But, like, what do YOU add? Is there no other service that accepts brief messages from any registered phone&#x2F;email and tracks the values over time? Is that filling a hole? Maybe if there is a hole you could build a platform that performs that function for anything. Individuals could use it for data like weight, businesses could use it for logging business things.<p>For example, I currently use google docs to track this kind of information. I just open a spreadsheet, plug in my values, and they&#x27;re automatically saved &quot;to the cloud.&quot; Normally I don&#x27;t even close the sheet; I just leave it open for weeks at a stretch. I doubt it takes fewer clicks to enter a single value into an already-open sheet than to send a text message. However, it does mean if I want to review the data, or rearrange it, or add another column, or backdate something, I&#x27;ve already got the appropriate interface open.<p>IoQS would work for people who don&#x27;t have a smartphone...but is there a lot of overlap between people who have an old phone and people who want to track quantified self data?", "time": 1461048884, "type": "comment", "label": "story"}, {"by": "graeham", "id": 11590765, "parent": 11525282, "text": "Sorry for the slow reply, thought I was so far down the list people wouldn&#x27;t be seeing it.<p>First - thanks for the feedback and discussion.

The original reason for SMS was to interupt the user to actually get them to make a measurement. I&#x27;ve since changed that the interupt still comes as a message, but the input&#x2F;logging is done through a full application. It also means that the application is more accessable for reviewing data, making changes, processing, etc - as you mention is an advantage for simple spreadsheets.<p>The advantage over a spreadsheet is trading some &#x27;freedom&#x27; for easier analytics.

It&#x27;s expensive, yes - you get industrial-quality products and a solution designed (and priced) for your particular needs. Basically, I&#x27;m talking about companies that were doing IoT for the past two decades, long before anyone ever thought of that acronym. I have a few observations:<p>- Everyone does exactly the same thing. HVAC, alarms, lights, window blinds, access control. There isn&#x27;t really much more to sensibly automate at home for an ordinary person at this moment. So they try to differentiate by look&amp;feel, UI and the type of installation - e.g. whether it can be laid over an existing building easily, or whether it would require to dig up the entire electrical installation and is therefore best done during construction or big renovation.<p>- Everything runs local first. As it should. Most solutions are wired, some are wireless - via Zigbee, LoRa, Wi-Fi, or some protocol, but still over a local network. Cloud services are often added to enable remote viewing and management via mobile devices, but this is a bonus, not the core thing in the installation. One company I talked with today ensured me that their pretty mobile apps &#x2F; tablet control panels have configurable network URL, so you can expose your automation server however you like or <i>not at all</i> - just point the app to an IP in your local network.<p>- A typical setup is expected to work fully locally and is resilient. In many cases, even if your central server goes down, your &quot;smart&quot; wall switches still work and control the stuff.<p>- The business model is honest. You submit your needs, get a quote for the installation, and when you decide to go ahead then the company comes, set things up, and it&#x27;s done. No silly recurrent fees, no bullshit subscriptions. You bought the hardware, it&#x27;s yours.<p>So basically, it works as it <i>should</i>. It&#x27;s not hot and sexy (most of your installation will be hidden in the walls anyway), but it is reliable and it is honest. It&#x27;s how grownups do business. Contrast that with the startup IoT bullshit.<p>As some of HNers mentioned already over the last few months, what we need is not Internet of Things, but an <i>Intranet</i> of Things.

What benefit do they get? The data by itself largely isn&#x27;t useful to them, and the extra device &#x27;smarts&#x27; often doesn&#x27;t require internet enablement. Nest doesn&#x27;t need to send your data anywhere; it just needs to be smart enough to figure out when you&#x27;re home and what temperature you like. Maybe a (secure, obviously) web panel to allow you to configure it remotely. That is, the benefit of a &#x27;smart&#x27; device to the consumer is currently largely orthogonal to the benefit a company gets from it, that massive trove of data. I think, as we move forward, and more and more leaks of data occur, more and more egregious abuses of the data occur (even by the company that sold the device), there will be a second generation of consumer devices, that don&#x27;t send their data to anyone except you; you gain 95% of the benefits of the current tech, but with a guarantee of end to end encryption.<p>In consumer spaces, there is, however, market opportunity for sufficiently complex devices. For example, Tesla, the data coming from the car can be useful directly to the consumer (notifying them of parts operating outside of expected parameters, etc), and the model could be changed so that data goes back to Tesla only when the consumer decides to as part of getting that part serviced; Tesla still gets relevant data, but not all of it, and the benefit of some people sending it (much like anonymous usage statistics for software) affects everyone. While over the air updates are cool, they could be done without the user information being shared, and they could be set to be disabled, instead requiring user intervention, for the security conscious.<p>But both of those miss what is perhaps the most intriguing application of IoT - industry. Where the collection of data from numerous disparate parts and places is beneficial to the customer. That is, a Nest (and its functionality) for a consumer is hardly necessary; they know when they&#x27;re cold, they know when they&#x27;re hot, they can change it. But for a multi-national conglomerate? They can run analytics against that data and find places that are losing&#x2F;gaining heat too fast, indicative of poor insulation, or poor placement of heating&#x2F;cooling devices. They can be notified of failures in cooling of rooms containing mission critical hardware, and respond quicker. Etc.

Our products are made locally, reducing the environmental impact of transport and logistics. We always recommend using wooden sheet materials from sustainable, FSC-certified sources.<p>Designed to made furniture on demand, Modoola products cut out the middlemen and logistics of global supply chains. Providing a more direct and personalised experience, customers still gain all the benefits of designer furniture without the long lead times and costly price tag. This approach cuts the delivery and lead time of a designer fit out to 1-4 weeks, as opposed to the 8-12 weeks typically quoted by traditional suppliers.<p>The key elements in our first hexagonal desk are simplicity of aesthetics and functionality, with options to suit any environment. Desks come in 3 min width: 120cm, 150cm and 180cm, allowing offices to maximise space.<p>Because our furniture is made on-demand, it can be personalised to your brand and environment, for example by milling your logo into the design.

Four of them involves what you already mentioned:<p>- Good practices are applied by design (like generating strong random passwords for each device); despite being trivial these are far from representing a de-facto standard in a market where these issues have been neglected for a long time<p>- all vulnerable communication paths are encrypted<p>- integrity checks are performed by both sides to ensure that over the air updates are genuine<p>- over the air updates themselves allow you to patch the device (with security fixes, etc) while it is deployed on the field (which is relevant in a rapid prototyping scenario)<p>One last word on how SMEs could trust Iottly.<p>Proprietary enterprise software (both on-premise and SaaS) need to be submitted to security assessments performed by third party authorities. Ok, this is important and we do have plans for that in the future.<p>But, in addition to this, it turns out that a wide spreading of the same code base increases security, by enabling cross testing processes, performed by multiple independent parties in different application contexts.<p>And this is one of the main reasons why we open sourced Iottly.<p>It\u2019s not that the SME itself can check

But rather than just refer you to Plato, let me address your exact situation, and we&#x27;ll do it with a nice particular-general-particular teaching strategy.<p>The US military could lay down its arms. Likely we would need all of the peoples of the earth to lay down their arms. I assure you, no one wants peace more than a professional soldier. Lets assume it happens. But there will still be people able to rally the masses with nationalistic messages. Even if we burned every book on the making of guns, arrows, missiles, guidance systems, deleted all the information from the collective conciousness, we would still have these bad actors. And their followers would be incentivized to develop means of carrying out their nationalistic ambitions. And then there will be war. Even if it&#x27;s with stones, they will make spears, arrows, crossbows, grenades, muskets, rifles, rockets, guided missiles and drones.<p>This generally comes down to simple engineering at a world scale: a prestressed sysem is more predictable than an unstressed system and often requires fewer resources to maintain. The threat of violence is more persuasive than violence itself.<p>So, onto the closing particular: the NSA. Someone will collect signals intelligence. Are you seriously asserting your government alone should abstain? Do you assert that the Germans, French, Chinese, or Pakistanis, Indians, Russians, Brazilians, or Laotians aren&#x27;t clever enough to do sigint or don&#x27;t have the incentives to engage in it, given the insane gradients of wealth and power across national borders?<p>So, yes, regulation is key. And the social outcry sends a strong signal itself. The regulations are merely an attempt to condense the social consensus to paper. The people who work at the NSA read the headlines. They read blogs. They read a lot. right? They&#x27;re in sigint. They read a lot. I&#x27;m fairly certain there&#x27;s are many very active debates within the NSA, at every level, about just exactly what is it that they should be doing.<p>Does that mean society should give them a pass?

Plus, we are talking about Plato who confused actual reality with abstractions, and Kant whose ideas had have led to &quot;instrumentation&quot; of reason; both of whose outmoded ideas have been criticized thoroughly in recent social thought.<p>I would similarly suggest that you &quot;<i>haven&#x27;t been doing your reading</i>&quot; on Foucault, Baudrillard, Adorno, Horkheimer, Deleuze, etc., but I am not going to do that.

But what I worry about regarding street lighting and anything municipal-IoT related, at least in America, is that a lot of IoT business models seem to be along the lines of, &quot;we&#x27;re not selling you an LED light, we&#x27;re selling you a monthly lighting plan!  It&#x27;s a whole new paradigm!&quot;<p>That may work for the corporate world, where timeframes tend to go in quarterly, yearly or three-year cycles, but in the municipal world, timeframes for equipment could be up to, perhaps 50 years or more.  The sentiment in this scenario would be, &quot;we need that manhole cover to continue to work.&quot;<p>If you have smart LED lighting (which was not discussed in this article), in a municipality, being sold on a monthly plan, and then the city has a down year, or a Detroit-style downturn or whatever, and the city tries to negotiate with the LED lighting company providing that service, that LED lighting service company can threaten to, &quot;turn off the lights,&quot; which would lead to all sorts of bad press for the city workers, who ultimately are just trying to live safe, protected lives working in guaranteed government jobs.<p>So I guess my contribution to this discussion is - I speculate or worry that companies may try to barter for that real estate by offering highly discounted smart lighting systems, because, &quot;hey, we&#x27;re already there...we might as well help you control the light, and provide you a huge discount!&quot;  For cities who don&#x27;t have smart CIOs and CFOs who understand this stuff, they are going to end up getting screwed.<p>Mind you, my perspective is totally American...could be different in other countries depending upon how these government functions are organized.", "time": 1476291073, "type": "comment", "label": "story"}, {"by": "nbadg", "id": 12695609, "kids": [12696892], "parent": 12694469, "text": "This is definitely off-topic to the linked article, but to your point re: selling an LED vs a lighting plan: I think this is largely a failure on the part of companies to transition to a service-based model in light of decreasing emphasis on consumerism and the greater importance of sustainability.<p>More explicitly (and with fewer buzzwords), since WWII the USA has been pushing consumption as a cultural value to fuel the economy. Everything has been treated as &quot;this equipment is disposable, with a service life of X&quot;. Arguably, goods producers still use the same process during design (since it provides a good optimization constraint), but the service life of consumables has been increasing. The LED vs incandescent transition is a perfect example, because you&#x27;ve gone from a consumable with a service life that is dependably short enough for the bulb producer to rely upon repeat sales, to an equivalent consumable with a service life that is so long that the bulb producer can&#x27;t keep its own business running sustainably. As far as I can tell, consumer-side economic pressures have encouraged this trend for pretty much every market in existence, though each individual market may have a starkly different rate of change (the medical consumables market being perhaps the slowest, at least that comes to my mind).<p>When you&#x27;re faced with that transition, as a company your best hope for survival is to transition to a service-based economy. In the mobile phone market (and to a degree, in the computer market), the service being sold has, essentially, been innovation itself: &quot;we&#x27;ll release a new phone every so often, and in exchange for your yearly contribution to our coffers, we&#x27;ll make sure it&#x27;s an improvement over your last model&quot;. But I think the phone market also offers cautionary advice: this strategy saturates once consumers realize they&#x27;ve hit the point of diminishing returns. Furthermore, efforts to do something equivalent with LED bulbs are rightly met with skepticism, because those diminishing returns are immediately and clearly evident. So even that is clearly not a sustainable solution in the long term.<p>So where do you go from there? Market contraction? As a company, that means you&#x27;re playing roulette. You&#x27;re going to try and find some other offerable service to maximize your odds of survival. But at the end of the day, I think it&#x27;s that discord between consumer interests and supply-side economics that have created this brave new world of LED lighting plans and iPhones on demand. Call it what you will -- perhaps another indication of the upcoming technological unemployment crisis -- but given the degree to which we&#x27;re developing these kinds of long-service-life consumables, I think the trend is only going to get stronger.", "time": 1476299057, "type": "comment", "label": "story"}, {"by": "x2398dh1", "id": 12696892, "parent": 12695609, "text": "I agree with you that there is a trend of, &quot;the service being sold has, essentially, been innovation itself,&quot; but respectfully, I don&#x27;t agree with your characterization of the driver behind that trend.  Widely held, &quot;common sense,&quot; a term which I loathe to use, is that the service life of consumables has been decreasing, not increasing.  There&#x27;s the whole anecdote of how things like vacuum cleaners in the 50&#x27;s would, &quot;last forever,&quot; because the belt they used was thick, whereas as manufacturing techniques became more sophisticated, they figured out how to optimize the thickness of that belt so that it would break exactly after the warranty wore out.<p>Not to disagree with you for the sake of online argument, but I believe the driving forces behind, &quot;innovation is the product,&quot; include, 1) Greater ubiquity of manufacturing knowledge, which is arguably a function of time vs. improved information transfer technologies, and 2) Increased ubiquity of digital services, which is also a function of time vs. improved information transfer technologies.<p>So basically, throughout the 20th Century, Bille Bob gets a hold of some files which show him how to manufacture vacuum belts, and so he opens up a vacuum belt plant down in Alabama.  Then Jackie Wu over in Hong Kong gets a hold of a similar plan about 10 years later, and opens up a factory in Shenzhen, and then the same happens in Vietnam, and so on.  So now what you have is basically a global economy of vacuum belts, which are basically a complete commodity - all because successive information-lacking regions gained more access to more information over time.  So now we&#x27;re at that, &quot;paradigm shift,&quot; where Billie Bob is realizing that he&#x27;s competing against the entire world, so he either needs to leverage nepotism (a short term strategy), protectionism (e.g. vote for Trump) or a third, innovative strategy, which may include the best value vacuum belts...kind of hard to build value...or turn those vacuum belts into a service, because building a service brand is not a function of intellectual property protection, and he can continue to hold a competitive advantage with a service business, indefinitely, as long as he can maintain that level of service.  That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re going to see vacuums coming out with sensors that tell you when the belt goes out and automatically sends you a new one via Amazon or whatever - it&#x27;s a huge competitive advantage over Jackie Wu back in Hong Kong.<p>Where do you go from there?  Well, using a 1980s mentality, you start going into other markets, you use your vacuum belt platform software that you built and you gobble up other, weaker companies in Alabama who can&#x27;t figure it out.  Or, using a late 1990s mentality, you create vacuum belt derivatives of some sort, and sell that data to rubber hedge fund managers to show how often vacuum belts are going out of service, so they can forecast and create short &#x2F; long positions on commodity markets.  Or you create a community forum on vacuums and talk directly to the consumer, reaching around the vacuum manufacturer, etc.  There are tons of different ideas and it is only limited to your imagination.

I&#x27;d consider putting a 10k pulldown on the CH_PD line so it defaults into powerdown mode. Do you have a multimeter? Insert it between VCC and U1 and between VCC and US1 to verify your sleep currents [1].<p>The 3.3v regulator could certainly be improved. Once you&#x27;ve verified that your sleep currents are within the expected range (&lt;1mA), consider swapping it for something more efficient. A board like [2] should work reasonably well if you set UVLO to the minimum value of 0.3V [3]. This should get you to a few months of battery life.<p>A large capacitor (500+uF) on VBATT will stretch this a bit further. You want something with low ESR (the batteries should be around 400 milliOhms total; try to stay under 100 milliOhms). Anything here [4] would be pretty reasonable (supercaps are also a good option).<p>If you want to go even further, switch to an ATtiny85V and run it directly from the batteries. (This will work with your ATTiny85 as well, but you&#x27;ll drop below its operating voltage while there&#x27;s still a fair bit of usable charge left in the batteries.) Instead of wiring to CH_PD, you can wire it to the enable pin on your regulator (unfortunately not exposed on [2]; it&#x27;s pin 6 on the TPS61200). You&#x27;ll need to level shift the ATTiny&lt;-&gt;ESP8266+sensor signals. The advantage here is that the ATTiny power doesn&#x27;t take an efficiency hit from a converter and the ESP8266 and sensors can be 100% powered down when not in use. This is what I&#x27;d do if creating this as an original design on a single board.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openhomeautomation.net&#x2F;esp8266-battery&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openhomeautomation.net&#x2F;esp8266-battery&#x2F;</a>\n[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sparkfun.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;10255\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sparkfun.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;10255</a>\n[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.circuitsathome.com&#x2F;dc-dc&#x2F;tps61200-board-modifications-part-1-changing-undervoltage-lockout&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.circuitsathome.com&#x2F;dc-dc&#x2F;tps61200-board-modifica...</a>\n[4]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mouser.com&#x2F;Passive-Components&#x2F;Capacitors&#x2F;Aluminum-Electrolytic-Capacitors&#x2F;_&#x2F;N-75hqtZscv7?P=1z0z819Z1z0z7l5Z1z0z80l&amp;Rl=75hqtZer3vZ1z0wkcyZ1yftwwfSGT75hqtZergjZ1yx4avtZ1yx4arcSGT75hqtZ173vdZ1ybcj9yZ1z0s5pqSGT&amp;Ns=Pricing|0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mouser.com&#x2F;Passive-Components&#x2F;Capacitors&#x2F;Aluminum...</a>", "time": 1480463739, "type": "comment", "label": "story"}, {"by": "emilburzo", "id": 13065393, "kids": [13066161, 13067274, 13066555, 13066211, 13067253, 13065494], "parent": 13065281, "text": "&gt; I built one of these temperature loggers and gave it 3xAA but it never lasts more than 2 weeks<p>For comparison purposes, I just changed the 3 x AA batteries on my outside sensor[1], the batteries lasted for 13 months (again, in outside conditions, including a very harsh winter).<p>I&#x27;m planning to write a post one of these days, but the gist of it is:<p>- attiny84 (don&#x27;t even think about using an Arduino)<p>- DHT22 sensor (looking into SHT7x for better accuracy, but they&#x27;re expensive as hell)<p>- TX module (I went with 433MHz because of better penetration)<p>I made 4 of these sensors, powered by batteries, so I can put them anywhere (within range, of course).<p>They send the reading every 4..7 x 8 seconds[2], both to keep the frequency clear (as required by law, I think it was 95% of the time) and as a poor man&#x27;s anti packet collision.<p>They all report to a master RX, which is connected via USB to my server (which is always on anyway).<p>A small parser reads from serial USB and saves it in Mongo.<p>From there I can see the data in a simple webapp[3].<p>Oh yeah, and as a bonus, I made another thing that intercepts the outside sensor and display it on a 7 segment display[4], which looks really cool (plus I don&#x27;t have to open the web page to see what&#x27;s it like outside)<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;emilburzo&#x2F;status&#x2F;799886284730892288\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;emilburzo&#x2F;status&#x2F;799886284730892288</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ambient-monitoring&#x2F;node&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;node.ino#L130\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ambient-monitoring&#x2F;node&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;node....</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ambient.emilburzo.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ambient.emilburzo.com&#x2F;</a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flickr.com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;eaglex&#x2F;30242342623&#x2F;in&#x2F;dateposted-public&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flickr.com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;eaglex&#x2F;30242342623&#x2F;in&#x2F;datepost...</a>", "time": 1480446345, "type": "comment", "label": "story"}, {"by": "joshvm", "id": 13066161, "kids": [13068697], "parent": 13065393, "text": "Do you really need an SHT7x?

Most (is it safe to say all?) of us carry around IoT devices with us every day that are based on software with documented, in-the-wild, security issues -- and the Android ones of us are the most at risk depending on the age, manufacturer and carrier of the device.<p>I agree with the author&#x27;s original assessment -- don&#x27;t make your device internet connected (or even capable of connecting to the internet), if there&#x27;s not a spectacularly good reason to do so.  The downside is just too big, currently.  If you plan on it, you need to proceed extremely cautiously and understand that huge companies with top-tier engineers -- <i>Google</i>, for instance -- haven&#x27;t figured it out completely, yet.  While their devices are probably better secured[0] than the IoT white-label power outlet I purchased on the clearance rack at Aldi (US), they still have a long way to go.  Is that feature that allows your dish washer to send you push notifications when it&#x27;s completed worth the lifetime of security patching you&#x27;re going to have to do (or going to fail to do at your customer&#x27;s peril)?<p>The biggest problem with IoT as it&#x27;s done, today, is a simple one of attack surface.  Every device independently accesses the Internet with a poor gate-keeper -- often a consumer-grade firewall which we <i>hope</i> is configured to properly firewall inbound, but is probably also running an out-of-date kernel, or has some other security vulnerability[1].  For the simpler devices, I lean more toward using the &#x27;hub&#x2F;Z-Wave&#x2F;Zigbee&#x27; approach.  At least with a hub, I have <i>one</i> device that is directly on the internet, and several that can&#x27;t do much beyond talking to the hub.  The problem here, though, is that none of these hubs are aiming to be the &quot;leader in security in the IoT space&quot;, (which is why my hub is a custom-configured Linux box w&#x2F;Z-Wave&#x2F;ZigBee dongle[2] which I can harden myself).<p>The problem for most IoT devices is one that I don&#x27;t see an easy solution to -- a common configuration is one of a low-capability device with a general purpose operating system on it with custom software probably written by engineers in a company that is too small to afford the necessary security auditing required -- and, effectively, putting it in the worst war-zone you could put it in.  And consumers pretty-much don&#x27;t care (yet), they just want the feature[3].<p>There was also one feature I felt was missed by the author, a hard cut-off switch[4].  We put valves on water-heaters, appliances that connect to the gas line, and just about anything of circumstance that connects to electricity.  If all else fails, or if I just really wanted the Thing part of the device, I can take it off of the network in a way that leaves no ability for the software powering it to bypass.  In a critical situation -- one where something prevents the device from being patched and the device will be recalled, the company can send along instructions[5] along the lines of &#x27;you can still use it while we work out the logistics of the recall, but it&#x27;ll just be a Thing without any Internet).<p>[0] I&#x27;m thinking &#x27;home&#x27; rather than the general Android ecosystem since a lot of Android&#x27;s problems are related to the phone vendors and carriers (at least in the US).<p>[1] And with IPv6 rolling out from ISPs, how many of these devices will have public IPs that will be able to be discovered every time they reach out to pick up the current time.  Don&#x27;t think that can&#x27;t happen -- I was shocked to find that my dad&#x27;s PC had an IPv6 address and a quick check from the first hit on &#x27;IPv6 Firewall Test&#x27; yielded all red.  I&#x27;m not sure how many of these devices have IPv6 enabled by default, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if some vendors enabled it (or didn&#x27;t realize it was enabled when it was).<p>[2] Which have their own problems -- but the worst they could do is turn my lights on and off ... at least my lightswitch won&#x27;t be participating in a bot net AFAIK.  I also don&#x27;t own any ZigBee door locks or the like (however, I can personally attest to the low quality of the physical lock I <i>do</i> have after spending a Saturday on YouTube making a &#x27;key&#x27; based on a video that showed how to break my specific, Schalage brand &#x27;high-security&#x27; lock).<p>[3] I&#x27;ve said more than a few times that I need to attach a smart plug to my washer and dryer because the buzzer is too quiet to hear and I always forget about my clothes during a cycle.  It&#x27;d be nice to get a text message.  It&#x27;s a <i>stupid</i> feature when measured against the risk (though, as mentioned, my smart plug isn&#x27;t directly internet connected).<p>[4] &#x27;Hard&#x27; as in a mechanical switch that actually disconnects the Wi-Fi&#x2F;network module from the hardware.<p>[5] And the honest ones will ship with the button in the &#x27;off&#x27; position with the &#x27;Connecting the Device to the Internet&#x27; part of the instructions explaining what it does, how to enable connectivity, and a little bit about the risks they&#x27;re entering into by choosing to connect it.", "time": 1495764895, "type": "comment", "label": "story"}, {"by": "bitmapbrother", "id": 14421825, "parent": 14421624, "text": "If IoT is a messy problem and Android is the device most at risk depending on the age, manufacturer and carrier of the device then where are all of the Android based IoT attacks?

I guess as always with life, everything becomes a negotiation between what you want and what you must concede to get it.<p>Often this concession is a resource exchange - you pay, they provide - but one that has few other expectations upon you.  For instance when I buy some breakfast cereal I don&#x27;t have to prove I have bowls, spoons and milk.  Market forces dictate that the widest market is desired and this is the one that expects the least from it&#x27;s customer. The store just wants to sell cereal. However, for some things I might want, I have to demonstrate my suitability to society. It might be dangerous to sell guns as widely as cereal or fiscally irresponsible to sell houses to unknown parties. The management of your suitability for various things is often held by other, trusted structures within society - government records etc. Thus the task left to the individual is to prove their identity so that these &#x27;suitabilities&#x27; can be attributed to the person present and to connect appropriate &#x27;suitabilities&#x27; stored in disparate structures e.g. bank account and gun license. Therefore, the key questions as we journey through this technological transformation are 1) can I pay and 2) can I prove my identity?<p>To my mind this is why the mobile phone is such an iconic piece of technology as it looks like it is becoming the preferred mechanism for a person to answer both.

Also, lots of people not groking the value proposition. Let me take a crack at clarifying some key points.<p>So first off, the project is GPLv2 whether you use it for commercial or non-commercial use. The team&#x27;s first language is not English, they are actually Russian and based out of Ireland, so there is bound to be some confusion. What they were basically trying to say with that, is if you need the extra features and the backend, etc. Those are not GPLv2 but the project itself is--no matter how you use it--is. I mentioned it to them team and they already corrected the site.<p>Second, the value proposition behind this is tremendous. Remember the days before Unix and DOS&#x2F;Windows ran on every machine in the world? Every machine had its own design, its own arch&#x2F;cpu, its own OS, and its own interfaces. Computing was cool, but each machine was really an island. If you wanted to run your code on another machine then you had to port it over. Then Unix and CP&#x2F;M-80&#x2F;DOS came along and you could write something on one machine and it ran (almost) on anything with the same OS. Thats the name of the game here. This is groundbreaking for embedded&#x2F;IOT development.<p>Real embedded development is hard enough as it is. If you&#x27;re doing a one off project for something in your home, then its pretty straightforward. Now try and take that to a mass production-scale product and the level of complexity is increased 50x.<p>Imagine trying to bring a product to market, you need to pick a hardware platform&#x2F;MCU to build with. Now imagine your suppliers hit a chip shortage and you can&#x27;t use that chip, what do you? Sit back and wait for 6 months? What Mongoose OS allows you to do is write your code once and run it on multiple embedded platforms, you would just select another MCU, maybe make some minor modification to the pinouts, flash the firmware and BAM, you are back in business.  Not to mention the fact that you have standard interfaces across all devices, MCUs, etc. It just makes development so much simpler.<p>Not only that, but you now have to manage potentially hundreds of thousands of devices (or millions if your product is really successful). What do you? How do you handle firmware updates? How do you track status of all those devices? How do you do customer support without a debug interface, well the enterprise offering (or something like AWS IOT) will help you manage that process and make your life a whole lot easier.<p>Now on the topic of why mJS vs. Python and a mix of C. You have to understand that embedded development is often <i>EXTREMELY</i> resource constrained. mJS fits into ~25K of flash space and less than 1K of RAM. This is awesome. It affords you the smallest possible functionality with the greatest possible flexibility. Write your logic in js and then call C for anything more critical&#x2F;performance.<p>I asked one of the team members and basically what he said was (I paraphrase) that mixing C with a scripting language is a pretty production ready solution. Obviously its preferable to write the critical pieces in C and then the higher level logic in the higher level language. It would be ideal if you could have type safety and compile-time checks in the high-level language. The ideal language to write logic in would be Go, and Go 2 promises to have a smaller runtime&#x2F;footprint so hopefully one day that will be a possibility.<p>In terms of everyone else talking about how the project is positioning itself, well let&#x27;s just say that marketing is a work in progress ;)", "time": 1502228877, "type": "comment", "label": "story"}, {"by": "iancarroll", "id": 14965158, "kids": [14965391], "parent": 14963161, "text": "&gt; mJS fits into ~25K of flash space and less than 1K of RAM.

It&#x27;ll give you a pretty good overview of where the teams head is at. Mongoose is using ARM mbedTLS with a few patches to optimize for small memory constraints. Theres support for quite a few of the most common crypto chips which are used. All the supported cloud platforms (AWS, GCP and Adafruit I&#x2F;O) as well as the mqtt support and local http&#x2F;ws support all have the options to turn enable tls. The greatest think, imho is that its possible to fully encrypt the flash on the espressif chips. For those who don&#x27;t know, those chips are pretty prolific in IoT and AFAIK mongoose is the only platform (aside from the Espressif SDK itself) which can do that. So pretty keen on security.<p>Your point about automatic device update being hacked is just FUD. There are can be multiple attack vectors on any given device, and thats why great security doesn&#x27;t just happen, it has to be a pervasive part of the underlying philosophy of the platform.

As such\n- The IDE is small (Visual Studio is 10 Gig; mine entire thing is about 50 meg)\n- The IDE includes tons of examples (similar to how the Arduino IDE has tons of examples) and there are fully explained examples in the manual\n- There is direct support for writing CSV and JSON output.  It will convert an array of data, for example, directly to a correctly formatted CSV line.  You can read in CSV files, too.\n- A number of common Bluetooth devices have built-in support.  Using a TI SensorTag or a Puck.Js device is simple instead of being a maze of Bluetooth services and characteristics.<p>What I&#x27;ve found to be real winners for design:<p>Lots of examples is a real win<p>Being able to copy-and-paste is very nice.  For example, when you paste most code into a modern email client, the quotes get changed to smart quotes.  My language allows for smart-quotes, and so the language doesn&#x27;t get mangled.  More subtly, a minus sign will get changed to an em-dash or similar, and my language handles those, too<p>Direct support for CSV&#x2F;JSON and common Bluetooth devices is a big win.<p>Not worrying about where files and projects go is a win.  In my system, when you write a program, the IDE simply keeps track of it.  It also uses Windows data roaming, so you write on one device and it&#x27;s automatically sent to you other devices.<p>What isn&#x27;t important is program speed.  Yes, a company like GM might spend a couple hundred thousand making a language more efficient so they can buy a $0.24 device instead of  a $0.25 device. At their scale, it makes a difference.  For everyone else, the cost of programmer time vastly outweighs pretty much every other consideration.<p>Also not important are most of the language details.

It is open source. It used to be maintained by the VA IT people with a host of third-party plugins. The name of the part physicians interacted with is CPRS or VA-CPRS.

A big proximate cause: they&#x27;re ditching the whole system to outsource to Cerner. Cerner makes a not-very-popular electronic health record system. Cerner did make more corporate donations to Republicans than Epic, the biggest EHR provider in the US. [3] Now, Cerner was already working for the DoD and there is some effort to harmonize systems, so it made sense in some practical ways, but it was a no-bid process.

The transport layer is mostly solved via MQTT, COAP, Thread, etc. Sure, we can improve there, but the real problem is the application layer. So I applaud Mozilla&#x27;s attempt to bring something into this space.<p>2. Bootstrapping this will require a substantial number of hardware vendors to sign on, both at the edge and at the hub layers. IMHO this is why Google Weave [1] never took off in it&#x27;s original incarnation. Bootstrapping this like they did with web stuff isn&#x27;t enough, because this isn&#x27;t the web.<p>3. Devices are only part of the problem: We need a software services layer, too. Think time services, IFTTT-like orchestrators, media services, etc.<p>4. JSON is a non-starter long-term: it sucks for small devices. They need a binary format that is easy to parse.<p>5. Request-Response isn&#x27;t the right pattern for most use cases.<p>6.

Like RC4, Speck could even be memorized. It&#x27;s like 30 years of block cipher design has been condensed into the smallest possible algorithm.<p>Simplicity is useful. I&#x27;ve seen on multiple occasions bugs in more complex algorithms, like ChaCha20. Test vectors don&#x27;t help as much--or at all--when you&#x27;re creating a bespoke CSPRNG as in the OpenBSD and Linux kernels that repurposes the core round functions.<p>Moreover, if we&#x27;re talking about backdoors, then code complexity--even just sheer number of lines of code--is the spy&#x27;s friend. For more complex algorithms it would be more practical to trojan COTS and FOSS software to, e.g., substitute an operation so you&#x27;d still get the same logical output but lose side-channel resistance.<p>I&#x27;m not an EE, but assuming all the standard reviews happen, I&#x27;d much prefer that hardware vendors use something like Simon. Hardware acceleration is the very definition of a blackbox. Hardware developers can copy+paste+munge as well as any software programmer, but there&#x27;s rarely any subsequent external review. The value of simplicity just can&#x27;t be overestimated here. Because hardware products lack the extra layers of transparent, open review, we really want to minimize the potential for accidental screwups. The simpler the algorithm, the fewer degrees of freedom they have to be creative.<p>The smaller block size and smaller key size profiles were dubious, but that&#x27;s a judgment call. The NSA probably sees so much bad crypto out there that the Simon &amp; Speck designers could have earnestly considered them a step up. Note that the debate about these weaker profiles was never about choosing them over some stronger algorithm. Rather, the alternative argument was that if a hardware design was so low-power and so low-bandwidth that those profiles were useful, it would be better to <i>not</i> have <i>any</i> crypto at all so nobody would have a false sense of security. From an engineering perspective I think most would agree with the latter; but as a practical matter commercial vendors no doubt will sell half-baked crypto in such tiny devices, and without a known quantity we&#x27;ll probably be worse off. In any event, those weaker profiles have already been ceded.<p>Assuming the algorithms continue to hold up to review, I think it would be a net loss to lose Simon &amp; Speck. And, frankly, I&#x27;m more suspicious of the motivations of, e.g., Chinese and Russian security services.<p>As for why the NSA designers haven&#x27;t been cooperating as much as the community has desired, it&#x27;s anybody&#x27;s guess. AFAIU, these designs were something of a 20% project for these engineers and they&#x27;re probably not getting much support from management for pushing these designs. I don&#x27;t even think they work in one of the departments these designs normally come from; IIRC they&#x27;ve claimed they tossed it over the fence to one of those secret departments and got a thumbs up. But who knows. And it shouldn&#x27;t matter, especially for something so simple.
