Due to CPS,\nevery family with children is\nat risk of essentially just\nthugs from CPS wrecking their\nfamilies, a greater risk than a\nbomb from a terrorist and\ncomparably dangerous.<p>TSA?

Part\nof the reason is that \nI watch for cops.<p>One night driving home in\nmy rear view mirror I noticed\nsome headlights looking like\nthey were from a car\ngaining rapidly on me.\nDriving late at night like\nthat, I tend to drive in the\nleft lane because I can\navoid cars entering or leaving\nthe road I am on from\nside roads or the shoulder.\nSo, when that car was about\n50 yards behind me, I moved to\nthe right lane to\nlet them pass.  Fine with\nme if they want to go way too fast --\ngo ahead, pass me, and be gone.<p>Well, that car shifted to the right\nlane also.  So, I had changed lanes\nand slowed down basically trying to force\nthem to pass me.<p>Well, it was a cop car with\ntwo cops.<p>I&#x27;d done nothing wrong.\nInstead, the cops had just\nseen a nice car driving\nat night on a nearly empty\nroad and decided to\nstop the car for no good reason.\nLikely that&#x27;s illegal.<p>So, they stopped me.<p>There were two cops,\none really nasty and\nangry.  He was a\nthug, out to harass a\ncitizen just for his own\njollies.

The cops didn&#x27;t\nshow, and the judge dismissed\nthe case.  I handed the judge\na letter describing the interaction.<p>That cop was a thug.\nHe was loose on the streets,\ncarrying a gun,\nmaking illegal traffic\nstops, harassing citizens,\ntrying to start fights,\nbasically a violent criminal,\npaid by taxes.\nHe was using his \npower to get his jollies.<p>Lesson:  Such things happen.\nThey happened with the\nNazi Brown Shirts.

There are exceptions to the rule - sometimes a journalist has to protect the people involved, such as in the case of a vulnerable crime victim or a political whistleblower (Watergate, Snowden), but then we&#x27;re basically relying on the reputation on the journalist or the newspaper in question - a track record of getting scandalous stories right.<p>In this case there is no reason to hide the names, dates, or location (as the neighbors already know and the court records are open), and there is no way to ascertain the credibility of the news source.<p>Absence of both a credible source and a credible reporter to vouch for the anonymous source breaks the chain of credibility - the article might as well be made up, and it usually is.<p>Another suspicious factor is that the claims are so outlandish - the more outrageous the claim, the more likely its a fake. When a reader is frightened or outraged he is more likely to disregard caution and share the story, and so it goes viral.

But if you&#x27;re arresting parents for not supervising their kids for 90 minutes, it&#x27;s more than a little hypocritical.<p>There&#x27;s probably a good reason for that: the foster parents couldn&#x27;t get the kids to eat anything else!

When I was notified they would be visiting our house, I did some research. I read the horror stories, and I learned a key detail: CPS is not a policing agency. The threats of taking your children from you and throwing you in jail are idle: only police and judges can do that. When you deal with CPS, only let them in your house if they agree to be recorded. If they refuse, or their supervisor objects, don&#x27;t let them in. Unless they have a warrant, you are under NO obligation to deal with them.

American has no &quot;normal&quot; anymore, and everyone acts based on their greatest fears, informed by our weird local news, NCIS&#x2F;Law&amp;Order fear-mongering mentality. We used to have class divisions that kept things a little normal within class lines, now class divisions have been destroyed such that everyone&#x27;s caught in a race to the bottom.<p>1b) I like to think I&#x27;m not really subject to #1, being an upper middle class white professional... but I live in a relatively urban environment, with a pre-teen child, and there&#x27;s a sense that one socially construed &quot;accident&quot; can send me into a can of worms that can take years to climb out of. So, until then, I&#x27;ll assume I&#x27;m relatively untouchable, because I&#x27;m not really sure what else my option is. I can see relocating, to one of my international anchor points.. permanently, at some point.<p>2) There&#x27;s a strong tinge of &quot;fuck them&quot; or &quot;they have no right&quot; or &quot;they shouldn&#x27;t&quot; in a lot of American interactions now, whether formal or otherwise. People are endlessly bothered by things they aren&#x27;t affected by. I mean, it&#x27;s not everywhere...<p>American culture is now a corporate construct designed to make everyone in its demographic purview feel strongly about something that doesn&#x27;t matter to them, whether it&#x27;s escapees with big dicks or the Kardashians. Radio plays the same 10 songs over and over and over again so you have to hit scan and your radio takes you through stations back to news anchor talking about news that doesn&#x27;t matter. And if you get home and turn on the TV you&#x27;re assaulted by the local news anchors with &quot;news you can trust&quot; or weather reports &quot;you can count on&quot;, and when you ignore that your co-worker at work will just force it down your throat anyway, and you&#x27;ll pretend to go along with it so as to have some minor smidgeon of false rapport, lest you come off as anti-social or.. critical.<p>I was just at a farmer&#x27;s market tonight where kids ran free and cops patted kids on the head and dogs were off leash and people were eating ice cream and yelling and laughing.

I think it&#x27;s worse in urban areas and in suburban areas, which is why I&#x27;ve been living in medium sized &quot;towns&quot; with urban centers. There seems to be less of that in that kind of neighborly construct. But neither can we talk about places like urban California, suburban California, and rural California in equal terms that cover those places, but also midwestern areas or southern areas or bible belt areas.
