    "about": "\nPancreatic cancer especially the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most lethal of all cancers with a five-year survival rate of less than 5%. Currently, gemcitabine is the standard of care for the locally advanced and metastatic PDAC. FOLFIRINOX and nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine are also used in the metastatic setting for patients with good performance status. Though it shows a better survival advantage over the gemcitabine monotherapy, toxicity is a big concern. That's why there is an urgent need to discover new drug targets or identify biomarkers that could help in the early diagnosis of the disease and thereby better survival. My lab focuses on nutrient transporters especially the amino acid and the peptide transporters. Since tumor cells have an increased demand for nutrients due to their fast proliferation rate, they upregulate these transporters to their advantage. We are trying to use these transporters as drug targets. Our study uses both in vitro (cancer cell) as well as in vivo (animal) models. Using cancer cell models, we try to understand the mechanism of upregulation of the transporters in cancer cells. In animal experiments we implant tumor cells in syngeneic mice or orthotopically in the pancreas of athymic nude mice and evaluate the efficacy of drugs in attenuating pancreatic cancer growth. Overall, the focus of the lab is to identify proper biomarkers and drug targets that can lead to early detection and better treatment of pancreatic cancer. We are also interested in identifying FDA-approved drugs that could be repurposed as an anti-cancer agent.",

Particularly germane to the current proposal, my research has been focused on translation research in pediatric cancers in identifying new drugs and the mechanisms of resistance. 1. We have established systemic models of lymphoid malignancies to show that ABT-737 synergized with the current leukemia backbone regimen of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and MCL-1 modulation is the key to overcoming resistance to ABT-737. 2. In addition, we proposed PI3K/mTOR pathway as a key player in dexamethasone resistance in lymphoid malignancies. Our data demonstrated that BEZ235 in combination with dexamethasone was synergistically active in both in vitro and in vivo models of pediatric ALL, and BIM may be a potential biomarker for the combination activity. 3. In our study of MM-398 (nal-IRI), a nanoliposomal irinotecan which is recently approved for colon cancer, we showed that Ewing's family of sarcoma is most susceptible to the drug relative to rhabdomyosarcoma or neuroblastoma, and that SLFN11 was inversely correlated with the activity of the drug.",

Towards that end, I have conducted task-analytic studies to identify novice traps (mistakes trainees are likely to make) in the laparoscopic surgery environment. Further, as the laparoscopic surgery environment poses a disruption of hand-eye mapping which is caused by having to view the target tissue indirectly on a monitor via a camera, I assessed whether basic perceptual-motor adaptation research generalizes to the laparoscopic environment. Such understanding is relevant for laparoscopic training. As the laparoscopic environment is known to induce high attentional demands on surgeons and surgical training takes place on patients, it is important to determine when trainees are too overwhelmed. I am the PI on an AHRQ funded research grant to validate a real-time indicator of operators' attentional load and attentional resource depletion in the laparoscopic training environment.

    "about": "\nThe 5-year survival of primary prostate cancer is nearly 100%, however, alarmingly the survival rate decreases to 29% in metastatic disease. Prostate cancer metastasizes predominantly to the bone, but currently there is no effective therapy against prostate cancer bone metastasis although it is the predominant cause of morbidity and mortality in the clinic. It is therefore of pivotal importance to identify the molecular mechanisms by which primary prostate cancer cells metastasize to bone. A major hurdle in our understanding of this process is the lack of an animal model that spontaneously recapitulates all the steps of this process in an in vivo experimental model with an intact immune system. To address this major limitation, we have developed a syngeneic mouse model that develops a high frequency of bone metastasis in immune competent hosts. This approach provides us with a novel tool to investigate cancer homing and interaction with the bone in an immune-competent host microenvironment more closely mimicking human physiology. In my laboratory, using a variety of pre-clinical mouse models ‚Äì xenograft, syngeneic, and transgenic mice - we investigate the molecular and signaling mechanisms that mediate prostate cancer progression including homing and growth of prostate cancer cells in the bone. I am interested in collaborating with other laboratories towards investigating immune-based therapeutic strategies against prostate cancer bone metastasis. In summary, our research endeavors are focused on studying the biology, signaling network, and tumor-microenvironment interactions involved in the manifestation of bone metastasis during prostate cancer lethal progression, with the goal of developing novel therapeutics against the disease. In addition to my interests in prostate cancer, I also have a broad interest in collaborating with other laboratories to investigate tumor-microenvironment interactions and host immune surveillance functions in other tumor models to uncover molecular insights into a broad spectrum of solid tumors.",

    "about": "\nThe overarching goals of our research efforts are to elucidate molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis processes and contribute significantly to prevention and treatment of different malignancies by basic and translational research. Thus, the focus is two dimensional: The basic science research projects focused on understanding the complex interplay between tumor suppressors and oncogenes in genome maintenance, and mutations or their deregulation in carcinogenesis and tumor development. Primarily, DNA damage response and repair signaling genes are tumor suppressors that constantly protect chromosomal DNA from environmental and metabolically generated genotoxins and from oncogenic replication stress. Mutations in these genes manifest into genome instability syndromes such as Fanconi anemia (FA) and Breast and Ovarian Cancer early onset (BRCA). In contrast, tumor cells also acquire resistance to chemo and radiation therapy by altered regulation of cell cycle checkpoints (ATM, ATR) and DNA repair networks. These mechanisms and their regulation are highly complex, and often they are differentially regulated in tumor cells, particularly in the context of oncogenic or growth factor signals they adopt.\nThe translational research projects focused on genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that tumor cells adopt to survive from oncogenic replication stress and from chemo and radiation therapy. My lab is particularly interested in understanding how activated oncogenic signals (growth factor receptors, signaling proteins such as Hedgehog/GLI, RAS, inflammatory and epigenetic regulators) influence tumor suppressors and cell cycle checkpoint signaling cascades. Our goal is to identify key regulators of these complex networks in tumors cells and develop rotationally designed therapeutic combinations to effectively kill tumor cells, which are also known as proof-of-concept based and synthetic lethality approaches. Areas of my translational interest are primarily Ovarian and Breast cancers, and extended to other malignancies.",

To achieve these objectives, the analytical methods implemented in our laboratory include the use of instrumentation such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and solid phase microextraction that allow the efficient extraction and detection of target analytes with minor sample disturbance. A particular interest is in understanding the complex odor picture available to the canine nose in the many military and law enforcement applications of working dog canine teams. Current forensic research areas targeted in the Prada laboratory include: human odor traces, chronic wound pathogens, explosive odor residues, and decomposition odor analysis in matrices such as blood, larval masses (maggots) and tissue for postmortem interval estimation purposes.

    "about": "\nMy expertise is in animal genomics with a focus on transposable elements (TEs), genomic fragments with the ability to mobilize and expand their presence in the genome. One of our primary areas of interest is bat genomics, primarily due to two interesting properties. First, several groups of bats exhibit TE repertoires that are unusual among mammals. Whereas most mammals harbor only 2-3 actively mobilizing TE families, typically of similar types, certain bats exhibit up to 20 mobilizing TE families of all possible types. We believe that this unique characteristic of their genomes may be influencing the second property of interest, exceptional longevity. Generally among mammals, there is a positive correlation between body mass and longevity, i.e. as size increases, so does lifespan. Of the 19 outliers to this pattern, 18 are bats. One species, Myotis myotis, which is characterized by the unique TE repertoire described above, has been known to live 46 years, while your typical laboratory mouse has an average lifespan of ~2 years. This extraordinary longevity is accompanied by few of the signs of senescence that haunt humans as they age. Because TEs have significant impacts on the structure and function of genomes, we see this as an excellent opportunity to collaborate with researchers interested in aging phenotypes as they relate to genome evolution and the evolution of gene regulation.",

    "about": "\nMegan A. Thoen completed her Ph.D. in counseling psychology and was a post-doc and mental health manager at the Lubbock County Detention Center for almost a year before beginning at the Institute for Forensic Science as a post-doc focusing on forensic assessment. She is a licensed psychologist and completes court-ordered forensic mental health assessments for the Institute, including supervising several doctoral practicum students from the TTU Department of Psychological Sciences seeking training in forensic assessment. As the director of the EPiC-LEO (Experiences & Perspectives in the Criminal Justice System with a focus on Law Enforcement Organizations) research team, primary research activities include studying the mental health of law enforcement members (e.g., police officers, correctional officers) with a focus on wellness and suicide prevention programming/intervention, and the treatment of disenfranchised groups (e.g., minority races and cultures, severely mentally ill) within the criminal justice system with a focus on pre-trial proceedings (e.g., competency to stand trial proceedings, in-jail mental health treatment). Potential for collaboration includes those interested in law enforcement and the incarcerated mentally ill, particularly with focus on identification of symptoms including mental illness and mental wellness (i.e., resiliency) but also physiological or neurological markers of health in these groups, and program/intervention effectiveness for addressing these symptoms.",

    "about": "\nThere is no effective therapeutic strategy against metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer. Prostate tumor cells constantly interact with the surrounding microenvironment during all steps of the metastatic cascade. Our research is focused on studying the role of the tumor microenvironment in prostate cancer progression and metastasis. Specifically, we study how the different cells of tumor microenvironment including cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) interact with cancer cells to fuel the progression of the disease. Broadly, we focus on understanding two critical facets of the prostate cancer biology with the goal of developing novel therapeutic strategies against the tumor-microenvironment interactions:\nOur approach to studying these interactions is through the use of in vitro and in vivo model systems. For investigating the role of stromal factors (prostate CAFs and bone marrow derived stromal cells) in maintaining and supporting the cancer stem cell niche, we utilize transgenic mouse models, xenograft mouse models, 3-D culture systems, and Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) models. In addition, our research focuses on how the host microenvironment including the immune cells have the potential to mediate the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs. This is supported by our recent studies that demonstrate prostate cancer bone metastatic microenvironment ‚Äì primarily through CAFs and TAMs - as potential mediators of drug efficacy in advanced prostate cancer. Our findings underscore the critical need for dissecting the crosstalk between prostate cancer and the tumor immune microenvironment in understanding tumor progression and drug response in an effort towards developing novel therapeutic approaches to target this lethal disease.",

Working under the assumption that SUD is an executive control dysfunction, his research focuses on biases in decisional processes that drive the inability to control both substance use and subsequent problematic behavior. Dr. Tuliao's current research projects include examining decisional processes underlying alcohol-involved sexual assault among college students. In addition to decision processes, Dr. Tuliao also studies the impact of culture on SUD, its symptom expression, and treatment. He believes that understanding cultural factors could inform SUD treatment and improve help-seeking behaviors and treatment utilization. Current research on this area includes a cross-cultural study on drinking behaviors and cognitions between the U.S. and the Philippines.
